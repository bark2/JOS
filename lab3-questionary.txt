=== This template file contains questions you need to answer.
=== Fill your answers on appropriate blank lines only.
=== Don't start any line with three equal signs "===".
=== Don't edit any lines starting from three equal signs.
=== Use C notation to write numbers: 42 for decimal, 0x2a for hexadecimal.
=== We may check most of the answers automatically, so "forty two" or
=== "26+16" won't work for this example. Spaces are mostly ignored, so
=== "  42  " is OK (without quotes of course). 
=== When asked to specify address & instruction, do it in the form of
=== gdb output "ADDRESS: INSTRUCTION", for example "0x7c26:  or  $0x1,%eax"
=== Don't make lines longer than 80 characters. You don't need to fit your
=== answer in a single line, you can start a new line at will.
=== However, when asked to fill "a table" make each table raw a single line.

=== Q In Exercise 4, can the function 'trap' ever return?
===   (yes/no)
no

=== Q What is the purpose of having an individual handler function for
===   each exception/interrupt? (i.e., if all exceptions/interrupts
===   were delivered to the same handler, what feature that exists in
===   the current implementation could not be provided?)
===   (free form, 1 sentence)
using the same memory layout for all trapframe types
and distinguishing between privilege levels

=== Q Did you have to do anything to make the user/softint program
===   behave correctly?
===   (yes/no)
no

=== Q The grade script expects it to produce a general protection
===   fault (trap 13), but softint's code says int $14. Why should
===   this produce interrupt vector 13? 
===   (free form, 1 sentence)
int14 is not allowed in PG=3(as specified in IDT), causing general protection error

=== Q What happens if the kernel actually allows softint's int $14
===   instruction to invoke the kernel's page fault handler (which is
===   interrupt vector 14)?
===   (free form, 1 sentence)
Page fault handler will be invoked without a proper error code.
In our implementation it just destroys the current env.

=== Q The break point test case will either generate a break point
===   exception or a general protection fault depending on how you
===   initialized the break point entry in the IDT (i.e., your call to
===   SETGATE from idt_init). Why? How did you need to set it in
===   order to  get the breakpoint exception to work as specified
===   above and what incorrect setup would cause it to trigger a
===   general protection fault?
===   (free form)
if the idt entry for breakpoint exception was set up with PL=0,
than a software int3 would cause a general protection exception.
so the initialization code in trap_init should specify PL=3 for the
breakpoint exception.

=== Q What do you think is the point of these mechanisms, particularly
===   in light of what the user/softint test program does? 
===   (free form, 1 sentence)
control user space privileges to various interupts(traps, hardware, software)

=== Q In Exercise 9, what causes the page fault which panics the
===   kernel when running user/breakpoint?
===   (free form, 1 sentence)
mon_backtrace function tries to excess above USTACKTOP, which is unmaped


====================================================================
=== Q What challenge(s) have you chosen to implement? (specify
===   challenge numbers separated by spaces, if more than one)
2

=== Q If the challenge requires changing the kernel source, list the
===   files which you have changed/added during implementation.
===   (one file per line, relative to lab directory containing .git/)
kern/monitor.c
kern/monitor.h
kern/trap.c
inc/x86.h

=== Q Describe you solution.
===   (free form, up to 500 words, don't need to use all 500!)
after a software breakpoint interrupt the kernel enters the monitor shell.
from there we have added the command to singel step one instruction which:
     sets the Trap Flag in Eflags and returns to the curenv by returning to trap().
the cpu then executes a singel instruction and raises a Debug-Trap which was added to the kernel
trap_dispatch() which in turn enters the kernel monitor.
we also check that the Debug-Trap is raised by the Trap-Flag by examining debug-register-6(else panic).
for convienence we have also added an option to exit singel step mode by adding the functuallity
of unsetting the debug flag in kernel monitor.
